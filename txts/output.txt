Former high school classmate Jake Allen's essay on Mark Twain's

Freedom is change. Freedom is the ability to do what you want when you want, to control your own destiny.  
The river brings about change in Huck. Huck’s love for Jim grows to the point where he would go to hell rather than let Jim become a slave again: “All right then, Ill go to hell.” 
Southern society is so ingrained in him that change and freedom are But the dual nature of the south and freedom vs slavery means that Huck is just as much slave to the system as Jim is. The society that Huck so tries to escape influences his every decision and makes it impossible to be free and free others.
If freedom is change then all those that hold back change are slavers. This means all those in the south who will not accept change are not accepting freedom. Even Huck, who is so willing to be changed cannot accept Jim for a real human being. The 
Twain chose Huck and Jim for a reason. Huck is white and Jim is black. Jim an adult, Huck an adolescent, but both are poor and both have an amazing drive for freedom. A drive to change their lives. Huck seeks escape and freedom from society’s  norms. From the widows “civilizing” and Pap’s abuse. Huck seeks freedom from all responsibility. He even gives up all the money he found because it gives him so much to worry about. Jim seeks freedom from slavery. From not being able to make his own decisions, from waking up every day knowing that at any moment he could be sold down river. 
The river is constantly changing. A duality in itself. Rising, falling. Flooding, drying up. Huge waves lap at its shores. It is absolutely free. It obeys no one and has no mercy. To Huck and Jim the river is freedom. It brings them hope and the promise of change. 
classic novel, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn:
When Mark Twain wrote The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn in 1884, everything had changed. A huge crater had split the nation in two. The North had laid waste to the South, slaves were free and people like Mark Twain rejoiced. A huge wave of change swept across the nation; never again would there be slaves and it was a time for healing…or so Twain thought. But then the KKK came, and Reconstruction began to crumble, with many slaves once again being subjected to a form of slavery. This is the context in which Mark Twain wrote Huck Finn and Freedom is the topic that he focuses on.
